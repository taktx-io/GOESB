# Changelog

All notable changes to OESB are documented here. Format loosely follows
Keep a Changelog; the project uses semantic versioning once it ships releases.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- M0 foundation: monorepo scaffold (runner, api, web, schemas, profiles, packs).
- Documentation: vision, requirements, architecture, roadmap, glossary.
- ADRs: record-decisions, tech stack, open-source strategy, runner security model.
- Specs: metrics, environment capture. JSON Schemas for profile & pack + CI validation.

### Changed
- Made language-agnostic / multilingual design explicit across docs: language is a
  first-class dimension with per-language pluggable normalization rulesets; no
  language is hardcoded or privileged. Added FR-2.6, strengthened NFR-12, and
  added an English example profile + pack alongside the Dutch ones.
- Added ADR-0005 (cloud-API benchmarks as a reference lane): cloud is included as
  a separated, clearly-labelled baseline via an orthogonal `local` | `cloud`
  deployment axis (FR-1.6), with graceful metric degradation, cloud-native
  metrics, and honest weaker-reproducibility snapshot labelling. Added roadmap
  milestone M5b. Edge remains the platform identity.
